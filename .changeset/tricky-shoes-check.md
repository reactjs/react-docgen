Migrated to babel toolchain

This is one of the big changes in this new version of react-docgen. It made the
code a lot more robust because there are now finally working TypeScript types
for the ASTs.

Another benefit from this change is that react-docgen is now a lot faster. 🚀 In
some tests an improvement of nearly 50% was seen in comparison to version 5.
