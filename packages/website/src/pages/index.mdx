# Document React \<components /\> in JSON format

<br />
<br />

`react-docgen` is a highly customizable library that extracts information from
[React](https://reactjs.org/) components and returns this information in a
structured machine-readable format from which documentation can be generated.

It uses [Babel](https://babel.dev/) to parse the source into an AST and provides
methods to process this AST to extract the desired information. The output /
return value is a JSON blob / JavaScript object.

It provides a default implementation for React components defined via
`React.createClass`, [ES2015 class definitions][classes] or functions (stateless
components).
