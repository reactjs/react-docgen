# react-docgen

[`react-docgen`](./packages/react-docgen/) is a highly customizable library that
extracts information from [React](https://reactjs.org/) components and returns
this information in a structured machine readable format from which
documentations can be generated.

[`@react-docgen/cli`](./packages/react-docgen-cli/) is a cli wrapper around the
library allowing using `react-docgen` on the command line.
